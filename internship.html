			<p>I enjoy the independence that i am given as well as the tasks. It as been lots of fun observing and shadowing other people that work here learning about what there jobs consist of.<p> 
            
            <li>What do you dislike about your work experience? This doesn’t necessarily mean you dislike your work; however, maybe you are learning that you prefer to be active or like office work.

            <p>I really don't dislike anything about my work here. I would like to work outside the office / other tasks that don't involve sitting at a computer but those will come in the future as right now I just have to train and develop ideas.</p> 
            
            <li>What areas of your work do you want to continue to improve?</li>

			<p>My knowledge of animals and their behaviors as well as more information on how nonprofits work.</p>

			<p>I have used canva.</p>

			<li>How is your experience shaping your thoughts about your future career path?</li>
