            <li>What do you dislike about your work experience? This doesn’t necessarily mean you dislike your work; however, maybe you are learning that you prefer to be active or like office work.

            <p>I really don't dislike anything about my work here. I would like to work outside the office / other tasks that don't involve sitting at a computer but those will come in the future as right now I just have to train and develop ideas.</p>
